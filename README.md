# twitter-sentimental-analysis
This is the project of one of my coursework: Social Media Data Mining. 

In recent years, social networking and microblogging sites such as Twitter and Facebook
have had a significant impact on how news is perceived, how information is shared, how
emergency messages are circulated, and how people share their opinions. For social medial
influencers sharing their thoughts and feedback has also become a major source of income. All
of this was made possible by the ability of these short messages to convey emotions like
happiness, anger, trust, as well as opinions about an issue. In this project, we use summarization
and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze data produced by users on one such website,
Twitter, in order to gain insights into the data generated by users on various topics.
Keywords: â€“ Twitter, Sentiment Analysis, Preprocessing, TFIDF, NRC-VAD lexicon, EmoLex
